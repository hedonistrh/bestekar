This repo is about my journey to _Music with Deep Learning_. You can watch and attend my journey via this repo and [my blog](https://hedonistrh.github.io). :checkered_flag:

The [first post](https://github.com/hedonistrh/bestekar/blob/master/blog_part1_draft.md) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/hedonistrh/bestekar/blob/master/LSTM_colab.ipynb) is about Music Generation with LSTM. I have used Keras framework for this project. You can find detailed explanation of my first steps for _Music with DL_ in this post.

I want to cover some classifiers for composer identification and emotion recognition for the future post. Stay tuned. :bulb:
